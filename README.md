# Homepage
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ZFQbTmJEt0w>

#### Description:
This project is a personalized homepage created as part of the CS50 course. It showcases my interests, achievements, and personality through a visually appealing design. The homepage is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and includes a responsive layout, interactive features, and external library integrations. It's my starter project, so it may not be the best.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Navigation bar with links to key sections: Home, About Me, Music, and Contact.
- **Dynamic Typing Animation**: A greeting section with multilingual greetings implemented using the Typed.js library.
- **Introduction**: A brief introduction to my background, interests, and aspirations styled with custom fonts.
- **Profile Picture**: A circular profile picture.
- **Footer**: A footer section with a friendly message and a subtle acknowledgment.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For custom styling and animations.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For a responsive layout and built-in components.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and animations.
- **Typed.js**: For the typing animation effect.
